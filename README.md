## Description

In this project, I manage to solve a common supervised learning problem (comment verification) using python. <br>
Generally, I follow a pipeline for each one of my projects and this NLP project is not an exception. The pipeline that I followed can be accessed in the images folder. <br>
- Firstly, I am going to try several data cleaning techniques using regular expressions and built-in python methods. <br>
- Secondly, I will build my initial document-term matrix to feed it to my machine learning models.<br>
- During the project, I came across the class-imbalance problem which is common in machine learning problems, so I am going to apply several methods to overcome this problem. <br>
- I implemented Multinigual-BERT because I did not find any Persian-BERT model that can be useful. <br>
