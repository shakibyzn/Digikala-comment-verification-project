## Description

In this project, I manage to solve a common supervised learning problem (comment verification) using python. <br/>
- Firstly, I am going to try severa data cleaning techniques using regular expressions and built-in python  <br/>
- Secondly, I will build my initial document-term matrix to feed it to my machine learning models <br/>
- I came across the class-imbalance problem which is common in machine learning problems, so I am going to apply several methods to overcome this problem
- I implemented Multinigual-BERT because I did not find any persian-bert model that can be useful

#### Techniques

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
	- Data Cleaning
	- Exploratory Data Analysis
	- Machine Learning
	- Deep Learning
	- Text Classification
